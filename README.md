Use large language model to simulate RNA evolution

## Ideas
1. In addition to the fitness score from large language models, fitness/evolutionary scores are adjusted for the secondary (and even tertiary) structures/motifs of RNA sequences. This would involve a study of RNA structural evolution from primordial ages.
